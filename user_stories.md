**USER STORIES**

As an influencer, I want to store my reviews of shows so I can share them with my followers later.

As a mom, I want to stay on track of all the movies my kids want to watch so I don't forget throughout my busy day.

As a screenwriter, I want to see what the top rated movies are, so I can have better inspiration for my projects.
